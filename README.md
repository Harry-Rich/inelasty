 inelasty

A lightweight workflow manager for running **VASP-based lattice dynamics
and convergence studies** for computational INS spectra production on HPC systems using ASE, Slurm, and Phonopy.

For an example of how to use inelasty, see the [example notebook](./benzene_crystal.ipynb).
 
For documentation on how to produce an INS spectra using abINS from the force constants see [abINS tutorial](https://pace-neutrons.github.io/abins-tutorials/mlip-phonopy.html#step-5-ins-simulation-with-abins-python-interface)
